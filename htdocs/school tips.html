                <h3> School Tips </h3>
                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
                <p> School Tips Page contains estudyanTIPS and focuSSISTANT, both of which are a list of
                    tips and pieces of advice that may help a PISAY scholar in her studies. While estudyanTIPS
                    concentrates on assisting the isko/iska with studying strategies, focuSSISTANT will aid you
                    with improving your time management, organization, and focus. </p>

                <h3> estudyanTIPS </h3>
                <p> <span> estudyanTIPS</span> is a compilation of studying tips that can help you with creating your
                    own studying strategies. They can be tips about studying, effective reviewing for tests
                    or exams, remembering certain points in a lecture, etc. </p>

                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 

                <ol>
                    <li> <span> Reading aloud</span> can help you understand the text you are reading better.</li>
                    <li> <span> Taking breaks</span> from time to time is better than continuously doing work without resting. Breaks can help you reset your mood, 
                        refresh your mind, and reenergize your body. </li>
                    <li> <span> Don't always take it easy on vacations given by the school.</span> Yes, we need vacations, but that does not equal always 
                        doing recreational activities. </li>
                    <li> <span> Don't skip meals.</span> Meals are necessary batteries for your body. </li>
                    <li> <span> Socialize.</span> Having friends and connections at school is a part of a good experience and a support system will help you in 
                        your difficult times.</li>
                    <li> <span> Step out of your comfort zone</span> when it is needed. Sometimes, experiences when you are out of your comfort zone will help you
                        grow the most — it can be a memorable experience, too! </li>
                    <li> <span> Ask for help.</span> When your own brain and even Google can't help you, try asking others for help. 
                        Don't try to solve problems that can be shared with others by yourself. </li>
                    <li> <span> Highlight crucial keywords</span> if you are taking notes. Remembering these words will help you in your reviews. </li>
                </ol>

                <h3> focuSSISTANT </h3>
                <p> <span> focuSSISTANT</span> on the other hand is a compilation of tips that will ASSIST you with improving your time management, 
                    organization of notes and files, and focusing in general. </p>

                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 

                <ol>
                    <li> <span> Fix or organize your study setting.</span> A clean studying environment will help you keep a positive mood, 
                        as well as an assertive attitude.</li>
                    <li> <span> Remove your distractions.</span> Turning your phone off while you are
                        studying, as well as closing social media tabs, can help you focus. </li>
                    <li> <span> Snack on candies, chocolates, or caffeine occasionally</span> for a boost.
                        (Reminder not to overeat! A candy a day is okay!) </li>
                    <li> <span> Don't cram.</span> Try to do a certain amount of requirements each day — for example, three requirements each day from Monday to Friday
                        while the deadlines are on Saturday. </li>
                    <li> <span> Maximize your time</span> if you have pending requirements. Don't waste
                        time.</li>
                    <li> If there is no one to help you study, <span> try researching videos online.</span> </li>
                    <li> <span> Mindmap</span> what you learned for the day.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3> Reviewing/Studying <br> Strategies </h3>

                <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 

                <ol>
                    <li> <span> Leitner System </span> - a studying method that uses flashcards and time
                        intervals. In this method, flashcards are divided into groups and the
                        student attempts to remember the answer that is on the flashcard. If
                        they are correct, they send the flashcard to the next box. But if they are
                        incorrect, they send the flashcard back to the previous box.</li>
                    <li> <span> Teacher Technique </span> - a studying method that lets students explain a
                        topic in their own words. In this method, the student gets their own
                        other "student" to whom they would explain the topic to. This way, itwill help the student form their own words and explanation for better
                        understanding. </li>
                </ol>
